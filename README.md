## 📌 Project Overview

This was completed as part of the **Numerical Technique Lab (EEE 3110)** at **Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology**.

### 🔨 Tools Used
- **AutoCAD** – for 2D drafting of the building layout
- **DesignBuilder** – for importing and rendering the 3D model

---

## 📐 Workflow

1. **2D Drawing (AutoCAD)**  
   - Created walls, doors, and windows using standard CAD layers.
   - Focused on dimensional accuracy and structural clarity.

2. **3D Modeling (DesignBuilder)**  
   - Imported the 2D DXF file.
   - Applied building elements, materials, and 3D visualizations.
   - Simulated lighting and geometry views for a realistic look.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Developed precise 2D design skills
- Understood the data flow between AutoCAD and DesignBuilder
- Practiced realistic 3D architectural modeling
- Gained insight into building performance simulation basics
